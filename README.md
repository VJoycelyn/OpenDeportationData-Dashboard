# OpenDeportationData-Dashboard
An open-source, real-time deportation data visualization tool 
OpenDeportationData Dashboard  

## 🚀 Overview  
**OpenDeportationData Dashboard** is an open-source, real-time deportation data visualization tool. It helps researchers, journalists, and policymakers analyze deportation trends using public data sources. The dashboard presents deportation reports as interactive visualizations, making data more accessible and actionable.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ Real-time deportation data processing  
✅ Interactive charts, heatmaps, and trend analysis  
✅ API integrations with public deportation databases  
✅ Secure data handling and privacy compliance  
✅ Open-source and community-driven  

## 📌 Why This Project Matters  
Access to deportation data is crucial for improving public safety, investigative journalism, and policy-making. Many law enforcement agencies publish deportation data, but it is often difficult to access and analyze. This project bridges that gap by providing an intuitive and open-source platform for visualizing deportation statistics.  

## 💡 How It Works  
1. **Data Collection**: Fetches deportation reports from public APIs and datasets.  
2. **Data Processing**: Cleans, structures, and stores deportation data for analysis.  
3. **Visualization**: Displays data using interactive charts, heatmaps, and dashboards.  
4. **Security & Privacy**: Ensures compliance with data protection regulations.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React.js / Vue.js (for dashboard UI)  
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI / Flask) or Node.js  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark / Pandas  
- **Cloud & Hosting**: Azure / AWS
